  <h2>Our <strong>story</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">In 1996, a young accountant named  Vijay Kanth wanted to buy his first home. It turned out that finding the perfect townhouse was easy, but finding the perfect mortgage to pay for it was not Bank-by-bank, offer-by-offer, it was time-consuming, complicated and tedious even for a financially savvy accountant.</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;"> thought consumers could be better served, and he asked himself, "Why not create a way for banks to compete for their customers' business instead of customers having to do all the legwork to find the best deals?"</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">And thus, a great Internet idea was born. Vijay founded LendingTree in 1996, and launched it nationally in 1998, which has put the power back into the hands of the consumers by giving them a centralized location to receive multiple loan offers by filling out one simple form.</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;"> does not own that townhouse anymore, but today Doug has created a team whose core mission is to empower consumers so they don’t have to go through the hassle and uncertainty he went through years ago.</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">The creation of LendingTree was a win-win solution for borrowers and lenders. "When we launched the site in 1998, we were able to empower consumers with choice, convenience and value,"  says. "And lenders could target consumers whose needs they were best prepared to meet."</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">In 2003, LendingTree, LLC caught the eye of media mogul Barry Diller and was acquired by his company IAC/InterActiveCorp that May. As a result, LendingTree, LLC joined a number of great businesses also recognized as leaders in their own industries including Ticketmaster, Ask.com, Home Shopping Network (HSN), and Match.com.</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">After a few years, LendingTree spun-off from IAC in 2008 to join newly established Tree.com, Inc. which included a portfolio of various financial matchmaking services the company could offer consumers (NASDAQ: TREE).</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">In 2014, Tree.com rebranded itself back under its LendingTree flagship name with its multi-product loan matching services under the LendingTree brand and its additional search services as:</p>
